> My recent CompTIA Security+ certification exam was successful. This certification, which is a [DoD-approve](https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/) security professional credential, is the first step in realising my ambition of becoming an authority on cybersecurity.
>
> This exam was a fantastic learning experience, so I'm quite pleased with myself for taking it. I gained a lot of knowledge about cybersecurity, and I now have more faith in my ability to use security technologies that are already at my disposal and to safeguard firm data and assets.

># 1. What is CompTIA Security+?
>
>`"CompTIA (The Computing Technology Industry Association) is the leading provider of vendor-neutral IT certifications in the world. With more than 2 million IT certifications issued worldwide, CompTIA is dedicated to helping IT professionals lead the charge in our digitally connected world."`
>
>`"CompTIA Security+ is a global certification that validates the baseline skills you need to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career. CompTIA Security+ is the first security certification IT professionals should earn. It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs."`

><u>CompTIA S+ is what I would define as:</u>
>
> A prerequisite for cybersecurity professionals is the CompTIA Sec+ certification. It provides the information necessary to obtain more specialised certifications and is the first step in a career in cybersecurity. Although not required, it is strongly advised for people looking for IT positions. When seeking further education in cybersecurity, sec+ educates you of the terminologies you have to know. Regardless of the field of cybersecurity that interests you, the extensive topics covered in the syllabus will be helpful to you.

># 3. How did I prepare for it?
>
><u>My prior experiences:</u>
>
>Before deciding to go after S+, I had some prior experience with cybersecurity. I had taken part in CTF contests. I frequently worked on improving my abilities on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). You can carry out penetration tests on simulated computers using the lab HackTheBox. While TryHackMe has various rooms (parts) where you can study some of the concepts overlapping with S+ topics, there is no theoretical component necessary there. Did they help me? Yes, it helped me imagine and recall it better to have past experience and practical knowledge of the concepts used in the test.

><u>How I studied for it?</u>
>
>Professor Messer's lessons, notes, and quizzes are the most accurate ones available. I joined his discord server, where I found others who had already aced the test and who were a great help to me. Dax and Orami deserve special mention :)
>
>
>I used to watch his videos (YouTube) every day. If there wasn't something that was hard to grasp, I watched it at 1.5x speed. I took notes on my own when I watched the videos. I used obsidian to make notes digitally.

<u>Test! Test! Test!

>I conducted more tests than I had revised my notes. I believed an app I discovered on the Play Store was a real find. When I was idle or waiting in line for something, I would open it up, select my least strong objective, and begin answering the questions. Even if I gave the incorrect response, the app would still explain it to me and make me feel better about asking the same question the next time I use it.
